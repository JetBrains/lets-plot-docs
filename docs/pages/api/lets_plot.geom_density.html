<dl class="field-list simple">
<dt class="field-odd">Parameters</dt>
<dd class="field-odd"><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>mapping</strong> (<em>set of aesthetic mappings created by aes() function.</em>) – Aesthetic mappings describe the way that variables in the data are
mapped to plot “aesthetics”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>data</strong> (<em>dictionary or pandas DataFrame, optional</em>) – The data to be displayed in this layer. If None, the default, the data
is inherited from the plot data as specified in the call to ggplot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stat</strong> (<em>string, optional</em>) – The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer, as a string. Supported transformations:
“identity” (leaves the data unchanged), “count” (counts number of points with same x-axis coordinate),
“bin” (counts number of points with x-axis coordinate in the same bin), “smooth” (performs smoothing -
linear default)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>position</strong> (<em>string, optional</em>) – Position adjustment, either as a string (“identity”, “stack”, “dodge”,…), or the result of a call to a
position adjustment function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>show_legend</strong> (<em>bool</em>) – False - do not show legend for this layer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sampling</strong> (<em>result of the call to the sampling_xxx() function.</em>) – Value ‘none’ will disable sampling for this layer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>tooltips</strong> (<em>result of the call to the layer_tooltips() function.</em>) – Specifies appearance, style and content.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>kernel</strong> (<em>string, optional</em>) – The kernel we use to calculate the density function. Choose among “gaussian”, “cosine”, “optcosine”,
“rectangular” (or “uniform”), “triangular”, “biweight” (or “quartic”), “epanechikov” (or “parabolic”)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>bw</strong> (<em>string or double, optional</em>) – The method (or exact value) of bandwidth. Either a string (choose among “nrd0” and “nrd”), or a double.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>adjust</strong> (<em>double, optional</em>) – Adjust the value of bandwidth my multiplying it. Changes how smooth the frequency curve is.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>n</strong> (<em>int, optional</em>) – The number of sampled points for plotting the function</p></li>
<li><p><strong>other_args</strong> – Other arguments passed on to layer. These are often aesthetics settings, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed
value, like color = “red”, fill = “blue”, size = 3 or shape = 21. They may also be parameters to the
paired geom/stat.</p></li>
